Aligning to a lot of the ideas that were expressed by <a href="https://joeprevite.com/learn-quickly">Joe's How to Learn Quickly</a>, I would like to take my first stab at what that would look like for myself. This will be broken down in the same way as he establishes it:

1. Make Your Map
2. Stay on Track
3. Cross the Finishline


### Make Your Map

When thinking of my map here are the answers to the questions I have:

> **Clear Vision**
> _"Learn Rust deeply and become a maintainer/contributor of the Rust implementation of MDX"_

To achieve this, I will need to complete a few objectives along the way:

* Read the rest of ["The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
* Read the ["unified handbook"](https://github.com/unifiedjs/handbook)
* Contribute to [MDX's JavaScript implementation](https://github.com/mdx-js/mdx)
* Build small projects with Rust to exercise all learnings
* Continue to document my Rust learnings on my blog

The designated time frame shall be: 5 months * 10hrs/wk * 4 weeks = **200 hours in total**.

The timeline would be best to accomplish this as:

1. Week 1
  - The Rust Programming Language
    - Read 3 chapters
  - unified handbook
    - Read ASTs, unist, unified sections
  - Work through 4 Rust by Example sections
  - Review MDX Advanced Section
    - [`API`](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/api)
2. Week 2
  - The Rust Programming Language
    - Read 3 chapters
  - unified handbook
    - Read remark, rehype, retext, MDX sections
  - Work through 4 Rust by Example sections
  - Review MDX Advanced Section
    - [`AST`](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/ast)
3. Week 3
  - The Rust Programming Language
    - Read 3 chapters
  - unified handbook
    - Read Tree Traversal section
  - Work through 4 Rust by Example sections
  - Review MDX Advanced Section
    - [`Components`](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/components)
    - [`remark and rehype plugins`](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/plugins)
4. Week 4
  - The Rust Programming Language
    - Read 3 Chapters
  - Review MDX Advanced Section
    - [`transform content`](https://mdxjs.com/advanced/transform-content)
  - Finish Rust by Example

I want to take this 4 week past first and evaluate velocity and efficacy of this work.
In addition I would like to have a project that I work on which is a bit hard to scope
without knowing where I am past this. I want to also scope work for contributing to MDX
but once again requires more research
