I am gonna share a bit about how I have integrated with `prism-react-renderer` and kept the
styles I was using back with `gatsby-remark-prismjs`. As I migrate my blog over, I want to record
a bit better about the tools I have been using. One of the most important things for me 
as I switch to [MDX][mdx] has been maintaining the readability of my code blocks. I won't be talking 
about how to install MDX, but the maintainers have a 
[great set of docs about it for Gatsby][mdx-gatsby] (which is what I use)!

## Adding a `CodeBlock` component to MDX

In a layout file (typically the topmost one), import `MDXProvider`. This is where one can add in
custom components that will override how their markdown renders it. These each match to some 
[shortcode][mdx-shortcodes]. In my case, I needed to declare the component 
for `code`. I went to my `src/pages/layout.js` and added:

```jsx {3-4,8-9,14}
// src/pages/layout.js
import React, {Fragment} from 'react'
import {MDXProvider} from '@mdx-js/react'
import CodeBlock from 'src/components/CodeBlock'
// ... some more imports
 
const components = {
  pre: props => <div {...props}>,
  code: CodeBlock
}
 
const Layout = ({ children }) => (
  <MDXProvider
    components={components}
  >
    {/* */}
  </MDXProvider>
)
```

The `pre` will always wrap around our `code` by default so we need to make sure
to pass through any props we receive down to the code block. In addition, we
can pass in any additional styles on the `pre` wrapper. I do this so I can
support smaller devices with my line highlighting.

## Writing our `CodeBlock` component

We told our `layout.js` that we should be using our `CodeBlock` component so let's go ahead and create that.
We'll use `prism-react-renderer`'s `Highlight` component to handle how to present everything on the screen.
This was an almost exact copy from [MDX's Syntax Highlight documentation][mdx-syntax-highlight]
but some important things worth noting are:

```jsx {7,11-12}
// src/components/CodeBlock.jsx
import React from 'react'
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'
 
export default ({ children, className }) => {
  // Pull the className
  const language = className.replace(/language-/, '') || ""
 
  return (
    <Highlight {...defaultProps}
      code={children}
      language={language}
    >
      {({ className, style, tokens, getLineProps, getTokenProps }) => (
        <pre className={className} style={{ ...style }}>
          {tokens.map((line, index) => {
            const lineProps = getLineProps({ line, key: index })
            return (
              <div key={index} {...lineProps}>
                {line.map((token, key) => (
                  <span key={key}{...getTokenProps({ token, key })} />
                ))}
              </div>
            )
          }
          )}
        </pre>
      )}
    </Highlight>
  )
}
```

1. We need to pull the language off of our codeblock and we will get that from the `className` prop.
We will make sure to use a big regex magic to get the language that we want. And pass that as a 
value to the `language` prop on `<Highlight>`.
2. We will pass in the `children` as a value to the `code` prop on `<Highlight>`. Then we'll have 
all the syntax highlighting working by default!

### Removing `gatsby-remark-prismjs`

And now... we can just remove the plugin entirely from our `gatsby-config.json` and everything should still
work!

```diff
plugins: [
  'gatsby-plugin-theme-ui',
  'gatsby-plugin-mdx',
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
-        {
-          resolve: `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
-          options: {
-            classPrefix: 'language-',
-            inlineCodeMarker: `>`,
-            showLineNumbersGlobal: false,
-            noInlineHighlight: false,
-          },
-        },
       // ....
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Updating Theme

At this point there is nothing else left but customizations! If you're like me, you want to make your site
a bit personal so I will show you:

1. Using other preset themes
2. Reusing themes you had with `gatsby-remark-prismjs`

#### Preset Themes

`prism-react-renderer` has a bunch of preset themes. You can find the list
[here][prism-react-renderer-themes]. By default, it uses the `duotoneDark` theme.
Import the specific theme you'd like and pass it as the value for the `theme` prop on `Highlight`:

```jsx {4,14}
// src/components/CodeBlock.jsx
import React from 'react'
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'
import vsDark from 'prism-react-renderer/themes/vsDark';
 
export default ({ children, className }) => {
  // Pull the className
  const language = className.replace(/language-/, '') || ""
 
  return (
    <Highlight {...defaultProps}
      code={children}
      language={language}
      theme={vsDark}
    >
     {/* ... */}
    </Highlight>
  )
}
```

#### Reusing the gatsby-remark-prismjs theme

You might have had a custom theme installed through your `gatsby-browser`. I have been using
`prism-atom-dark` theme for a long time and it has been great! To keep using it, I just needed
to tell the `theme` is `undefined`. This is an escape hatch that let's `prism-react-renderer` know
we will handle the themes with global CSS declared elsewhere.

Make sure in you have your css file imported:

```js
// gatsby-browser.js
 
// This is the source path to my CSS theme
require('./src/assets/css/prism-atom-dark.css')
```

Then in our `CodeBlock` component: 

```jsx {13}
// src/components/CodeBlock.jsx
import React from 'react'
import Highlight, { defaultProps } from 'prism-react-renderer'
 
export default ({ children, className }) => {
  // Pull the className
  const language = className.replace(/language-/, '') || ""
 
  return (
    <Highlight {...defaultProps}
      code={children}
      language={language}
      theme={undefined}
    >
     {/* ... */}
    </Highlight>
  )
}
```

### Conclusion

And that's a wrap! This was an excellent fun project for me over the weekend. There are a few things I will 
expand on, like how do I keep my line highlighting now that I am using `prism-react-renderer`! Let me know if this
helped you out!
