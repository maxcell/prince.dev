Imagine, you're starting your day on a JIRA ticket, you want to understand that weird bug behavior on your local dev environment. However, any time you startup your project on a local environment you need to have at least 3-4 terminal sessions running just for the fullness of your application to work. That becomes tedious to do manually.

In order to be living our best work life, we need to free ourselves of tasks that are frequently by hand. Today, we're gonna learn a bit about building our own custom Python script for [iTerm2](iterm2) to manage this workflow.

#### Prerequisites

- macOSX (v10.12 or above!)
- Installed [iTerm2](iterm2-downloads) to your system
- Rudimentary Bash scripting Knowledge (enough to navigate through the terminal)

### Initial Setup

[iterm2]: https://github.com/gnachman/iTerm2
