                Howdy! I'm Maxcell Prince Wilson, but you can call me Prince. I am a person who cares about making 
                better communities one step at a time. Whether it is through giving talks at meetups/conferences,
                or building and securing technology to make people's lives better.

                I previously worked as a software engineer over at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>, powered by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://wework.com/">WeWork</a>.
                I started off as an instructor there and helped over 400 folks transition into a career of technology!
                Some of my previous work includes working at Clarifai and State Farm Insurance.

                I graduated with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science with a focus in security over at the University of Central Florida. Back in school, I founded our tech club with a bunch of my friends,
                known as Tech Knights. We also created our first intercollegiate hackathon known as <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://knighthacks.org/">Knight Hacks</a>.

                Now, I enjoy exploring New York City! I look for opportunities to give back to communities that helped me become who I am today, through mentorship and open source.
                But most of all, I really really love corgis.
