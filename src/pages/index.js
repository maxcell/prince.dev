    <h2>#BlackLivesMatter</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to my site. You may have originally intended to come for some tech content. While it is easy to go on reading about my latest content about JavaScript, I would like for you to take the time to support organizations that are helping my brothers and sisters fight and survive during these absolutely difficult times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being Black in tech is absolutely difficult because many folks are not interested in this sensitive topic even when it is happening predominantly in the world. But I want you to take some time and make a donation to an organization because anything you can give matters. If you can convince your employer to give something, it matters. If you can just take some time and amplify these places as opportunities, it matters.
    </p>
